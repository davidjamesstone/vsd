# vsd

`visdev` is a web-based development environment built using Node.js.
It can be used to edit any text content but it is designed specifically to build [hapi.js](http://hapijs.com) web applications and services.

It encourages using configuration, conventions and metadata to build and test robust [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) applications.

## Quick start

Scaffold a new vsd project

`vsd -c myapp`

Start `vsd` and open the link below in your browser.
`vsd` uses port 3000 by default. 
Replace `<my-dir>` with the path where you created the project. 

`http://localhost:3000/?path=/<my-dir>/myapp`

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/davidjamesstone/vsd/wiki) docs for more info.

## Features

`vsd`â€™s current features:

- File explorer tree view
- Autosave
- File operations (create/delete/rename files and directories etc.)
- Syntax highlighted code editing for many programming languages

## Meta

There are two special files names `vsd` looks for. 

Files with the name ending in `db.json` are data models that are edited with a custom database designer UI.
These can be used to generate [mongoosejs](http://mongoosejs.com/) models.

Files with the name ending in `routes.json` are data models that are edited with a custom route table designer UI.
These can be used to generate `hapi` routes.

*** WARNING ***:
================
If you'd like to try out this editor that's great BUT PLEASE USE CAUTION.

Ensure any code is backed up regularly.
I would not like it to be responsible for any work lost.

Also, there is no authentication or security built in. That is left to you. Do not run on a publicly accessible server/port.
